                move my bitcoin from a crypto exchange ASAP?</a></h2>
        <p>If you have bitcoin on a Bitcoin or crypto exchange, move it ASAP to your own Bitcoin wallet. Don't choose
            the trade-off for convenience. They make it easy to store your bitcoin and give low fees on each transaction
            you make. Below it will be explained how. Here are a few reasons why an exchange is a high risk:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your bitcoin on an exchange is not yours.</strong>
                <p>They have full control over your bitcoin. If they're not giving you your bitcoin because it's seized,
                    frozen or blocked, then you're out of luck. It's the same with money in your bank account.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exchanges have a risk to get hacked.</strong>
                <p>Especially exchanges that also use crypto (every cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin).</p>

                <p>Chainanalytics companies work with governments, as well as crypto exchanges, especially American ones

                    with all your Bitcoin transactions.</p>

                <p>Mopst crypto exchanges work with chain analytics companies to comply with regulations, prevent
                    illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>

                <p>They can give bitcoin coming from a specific Bitcoin address a red signal that allows exchanges,
                    usually from the government, to censor or even take away this Bitcoin transaction. The latter is
                    only possible if it is through an exchange or through a Bitcoin wallet that you do not manage
                    yourself.</p>

        <h2 id="own-your-bitcoin"><a href="#own-your-bitcoin">Own your bitcoin</a></h2>

        <p>When your bitcoin is on a Bitcoin or crypto exchange, then you do not own it. The exchange has total control.
            Just like your money in the bank. To truly own it is to have your bitcoin in a wallet you fully control,
            also called a non-custodial wallet.</p>

        <p>Below are steps to create a bitcoin wallet you truly own:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to the website of <a href="https://bluewallet.io/" target="_blank">Blue Wallet</a>, download the
                wallet via the Play Store of App Store, install it on your phone and open the app.

                <p>If the government decides to censor this app via the Play Store (Android), then get an Android phone
                    and download the app outside the Play Store on their <a
                        href="https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/releases" target="_blank">Github releases
                        page</a>. Select the latest version and choose the .apk file. Download this file, open and
                    install the app.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Tap the button "Add now" and on the next screen tap the button "Create" to create a Bitcoin wallet.</li>
            <li>Your wallet has been created and Blue Wallet shows 12 words. These words are also called recovery
                phrase, seed phrase, mnemonic phrase. It's easier to think of them as backup words or restore words.
                These 12 words are the most important things to store and keep safe. These words ARE your bitcoin. When
                you lose them, you have lost your bitcoin.

                <p>Write the words down on 2 pieces of paper and store them in 2 different places. Tap on the button
                    "OK, I wrote it down".</p>
            </li>
            <li>Now you're ready to receive bitcoin in a wallet you control. That means authorities can't access your
                bitcoin. Only those that has access to the 12 words. Hopefully that is you.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="receiving-bitcoin"><a href="#receiving-bitcoin">Receiving bitcoin</a></h2>

        <p>When you sell stuff, products, services, money in your bank account or cash for bitcoin, then it needs to be
            send to a Bitcoin address:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open Blue Wallet and select your wallet by tapping on the blue area (it has 0 BTC balance).</li>
            <li>It shows the buttons "Receive" and "Send". Tap the button "Receive".</li>
            <li>It shows a QR-code and below the Bitcoin address.

                <p>You can copy the Bitcoin address and send it to the person that wants to send you bitcoin. You can
                    also use this to send it from an exchange to your Bitcoin address and thereby moving your bitcoin
                    out of the exchange and into a wallet you own and control.</p>

                <p>When you give the address to someone else, they can enter the number of bitcoin. You can also make
                    sure that they send you a specific amount of bitcoin. Do this by selecting the "Receive with amount"
                    option on the Receive screen in Blue Wallet. Enter the amount in your currency or in bitcoin. Then
                    the person that wants to send you bitcoin has to scan the QR-code. Inside the QR-code is the Bitcoin
                    address including the amount.</p>
            </li>
            <li>When the other person sends you bitcoin or when you send your bitcoin from your exchange to your own
                wallet, then at some point you'll see a pending notification in Blue Wallet. This means a transaction is
                scheduled to be send to you, but the process is not final. Only until you see at least one confirmation,
                should you consider this as final. The higher the amount, the more confirmations you should consider. It
                looks like this in Blue Wallet:<br>
                Conf: 1.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="test-bitcoin-backup"><a href="#test-bitcoin-backup">Test the backup of your Bitcoin</a></h2>

        <p>After you've moved your bitcoin from your crypto exchange to your own wallet, the second most important step
            is to test your Bitcoin backup.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>First make sure you have <a href="#receiving-bitcoin">written down your 12 words</a> (bitcoin backup) on
                paper.</li>
            <li>Send a small number of bitcoin to your own wallet (Blue Wallet) on your mobile.</li>
            <li>When the transaction is final and you have at least 1 confirmation (Conf: 1), then remove the Blue
                Wallet app from your phone. Imagine a scenario where you've lost your mobile phone and you bought or got
                another phone.

                <p>Don't worry, your bitcoin are not in your phone and they are not in your Bitcoin Wallet app. They are
                    on the Bitcoin blockchain, also called the Bitcoin network. This is a network of computers worldwide
                    running the Bitcoin software. Each computer keeps track of who owns what without using personally
                    identifiable information. This means your bitcoin is on all these computers worldwide.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#receiving-bitcoin">Install Blue Wallet</a> again, tap the button "Add now" and on the next
                screen tap "Import wallet".</li>
            <li>Enter your 12 words and tap on the button "Import".</li>
            <li>When it's ready you'll receive a notification: "Your wallet has been successfully imported". Have some
                patience as it will update your bitcoin balance soon.</li>
            <li>Now you've tested your backup and you know that it works. Now you can send the rest of your bitcoin to
                your wallet.</li>
        </ol>
